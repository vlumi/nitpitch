# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**How this file is maintained:** a user-facing PR writes its own bullet under
`### Unreleased (next build)` as part of that PR. The release lane
(`make release`) only *stamps* that heading with the build number it cuts and
opens a fresh empty `Unreleased` above it — it never writes entries itself. The
`### Unreleased (next build)` heading is therefore load-bearing: the stamping
script (`Scripts/release-lib.sh`) matches it exactly, and expects its list items
to follow immediately with nothing in between.

Apple builds are identified as `version (build)`; the build number is shared
across iOS and macOS and bumped on every release so the two never diverge.

## [0.1.0] — unreleased

The first version. Not yet released: build 0 means nothing has been cut, and the
first `make release` will produce build 1.

### Unreleased (next build)

- Initial project scaffold: XcodeGen spec for iOS 16+ / macOS 14+ app targets,
  the `NitpitchCore` / `NitpitchKit` package split, CI (lint, coverage-gated tests,
  both platform builds), and the four-step release lane.
- Pitch detection by the McLeod Pitch Method over vDSP — sub-cent accuracy
  across the supported range, with octave-error and clarity guards.
- Violin tuning as the primary case, with viola, cello, double bass, guitar, and
  bass guitar sharing the same detector, plus a chromatic mode.
- Adjustable reference pitch (A=390…466), defaulting to A=440.
- Named the app **Nitpitch**, and renamed the sources, schemes, and bundle id
  (`fi.misaki.nitpitch`) from the `Tuner` placeholder to match.
